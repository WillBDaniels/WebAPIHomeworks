The answer to the question in the assignment is as follows:
Really, in my opinion, the primary reason to not grant Oauth tokens in the main flow is because you don't want to have a conflict of interests in your data flow. Ex: if you're handling the 'verification and "do stuff"' part of the flow, then you shouldn't conflate that with the 'generate token' part of the flow. Really they are two entirely different operations. Especially in the world of REST, where everything should be modeled as atomically as possible, doing two things at once like that (generating and validating the token), goes against the protocol pretty heavily. It also makes it worlds easier to debug/secure the proxy, since each endpoint only does one single thing, which is nice.
